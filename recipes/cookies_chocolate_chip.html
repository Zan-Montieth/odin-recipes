    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chocolate chip cookies are an all-time classic treat that are loved by
      people of all ages. This recipe yields soft and chewy cookies that are
      studded with pockets of melty, semisweet chocolate chips. The cookies have
      a slightly crispy exterior and a tender, cakey interior, which make them
      incredibly addictive. The butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar
      provide a rich and buttery flavor to the cookies, while the vanilla
      extract adds a hint of warmth and depth. The cookies are perfect for a
      snack
