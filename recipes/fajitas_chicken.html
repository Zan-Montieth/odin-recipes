    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken Fajitas is a classic Tex-Mex dish that is bursting with flavor and
      color. Thinly sliced chicken is seasoned with a blend of chili powder,
      cumin, and garlic powder, and then pan-fried until golden brown. Sliced
      bell peppers and onions are added to the pan, which add sweetness and
      crunch to the dish. The fajitas are then served on warm flour tortillas,
      which provide a soft and pliable base for the filling. Toppings such as
      sour cream, shredded cheese, and guacamole add creamy, tangy, and buttery
      flavors to the dish, making it a crowd-pleaser for any occasion.
